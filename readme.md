Craft the portal, gather your supplies, venture in, survive and loot, finally defeat the boss to exit.
Entrance portal is lodestone surrounded by 8 crying obsidian.

Entrance: lodestone surrounded by crying obsidian

Warning: Currently there is only 1 boss room, and it is not yet guaranteed how soon you will come across it, so you may become trapped. apologies if this happens to you. Will be fixed in future versions.

# Plan
add time/stage based generation; start with larger door counts, then decrease. expand than wrap up
make dimension scaling a multiple of 48. dungeons could then join up
fix entry and exit spawns
