# About
An infinite dungeon to explore in survival.
Craft the portal, gather your supplies, venture in, survive and loot, finally defeat the boss to exit.
Entrance portal is lodestone surrounded by 8 crying obsidian.

Warning: Currently there is only 1 boss room, and it is not yet guaranteed how soon you will come across it, so you may become trapped. apologies if this happens to you. Will be fixed in future versions.
